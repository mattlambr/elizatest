# Characterfile

The goal of this project is to create a simple, easy-to-use format for generating and transmitting character files. You can use these character files out of the box with [Eliza](https://github.com/lalalune/eliza) or other LLM agents.

## Getting Started - Generate A Characterfile From Your Twitter

1. Open Terminal. On Mac, you can press Command + Spacebar and search for "Terminal". If you're using Windows, use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Type `npx tweets2character` and run it. If you get an error about npx not existing, you'll need to install Node.js
3. If you need to install node, you can do that by pasting `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash` into your terminal to install Node Version Manager (nvm)
4. Once that runs, make a new terminal window (the old one will not have the new software linked) and run `nvm install node` followed by `nvm use node`
5. Now copy and paste `npx tweets2character` into your terminal again.
6. NOTE: You will need to get a [Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) API key. Paste that in when prompted
7. You will need to get the path of your Twitter archive. If it's in your Downloads folder on a Mac, that's ~/Downloads/<name of archive>.zip
8. If everything is correct, you'll see a loading bar as the script processes your tweets and generates a character file. This will be output at character.json in the directory where you run `npx tweets2character`. If you run the command `cd` in the terminal before or after generating the file, you should see where you are.

## Schema

The JSON schema for the character file is [here](schema/character.schema.json). This also matches the expected format for [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

Typescript types for the character file are [here](examples/types.d.ts).

## Examples

### Example Character file
Basic example of a character file, with values that are instructional
[examples/example.character.json](examples/example.character.json)

### Basic Python Example
Read the example character file and print the contents
[examples/example.py](examples/example.py)

### Python Validation Example
Read the example character file and validate it against the JSON schema
[examples/validate.py](examples/validate.py)

### Basic JavaScript Example
Read the example character file and print the contents
[examples/example.mjs](examples/example.mjs)

### JavScript Validation Example
Read the example character file and validate it against the JSON schema
[examples/validate.mjs](examples/validate.mjs)

# Scripts

You can use the scripts the generate a character file from your tweets, convert a folder of documents into a knowledge file, and add knowledge to your character file.

Most of these scripts require an OpenAI or Anthropic API key.

## tweets2character

Convert your twitter archive into a .character.json

First, download your Twitter archive here: https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-x-archive

You can run tweets2character directly from your command line with no downloads:

```sh
npx tweets2character
```

Note: you will need node.js installed. The easiest way is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Then clone this repo and run these commands:

```sh
npm install
node scripts/tweets2character.js twitter-2024-07-22-aed6e84e05e7976f87480bc36686bd0fdfb3c96818c2eff2cebc4820477f4da3.zip # path to your zip archive
```

Note that the arguments are optional and will be prompted for if not provided.

## folder2knowledge

Convert a folder of images and videos into a .knowledge file which you can use with [Eliza](https://github.com/lalalune/eliza). Will convert text, markdown and PDF into normalized text in JSON format.

You can run folder2knowledge directly from your command line with no downloads:

```sh
npx folder2knowledge <path/to/folder>
```

```sh
npm install
node scripts/folder2knowledge.js path/to/folder # path to your folder
```

Note that the arguments are optional and will be prompted for if not provided.

## knowledge2character

Add knowledge to your .character file from a generated knowledge.json file.

You can run knowledge2character directly from your command line with no downloads:

```sh
npx knowledge2character <path/to/character.character> <path/to/knowledge.knowledge>
```

```sh
npm install
node scripts/knowledge2character.js path/to/character.character path/to/knowledge.knowledge # path to your character file and knowledge file
```

Note that the arguments are optional and will be prompted for if not provided.
